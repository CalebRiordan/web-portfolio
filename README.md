## Angular + Typescript + ASP.NET

The frontend of the portfolio website was developed with [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular) for versatile DOM manipulation features and combined with a blend of [Typescript](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-typescript/), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics), and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS). It interacts with a [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/what-is-aspnet) API, which utilizes the [Entity Framework Core](https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/entityframework6/what-is-entityframework.aspx) toolset for seamless communication with the database hosted through [Microsoft's Azure Cloud Services](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Windows-Azure), ensuring efficient data interactions.

The API offers basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for data related to my personal projects. There is also a dashboard that can be accessed only by the owner of the application, the code for which has been included in the repository to help present the scope of this project more accurately.

## Layout of the website


### About Me section

The About Me section of the website is used as to introduce me and show a bit of my character. I decided to mix my interest in cooking with my passion for code, and reveal the secret recipe to my portfolio website!


### Skills section

The Skills section is a simple display of the technology I have gained knowledge and experience with. Feel free to click on the icons and read about the technology if you are unfamiliar with it. My CV can be viewed as a pdf in a separate tab in the browser


### Projects section

The Projects section is the most important aspect of the website; the very purpose I created it. Users can browse my top four personal projects (with thumbnails), view the code on GitHub, and even interact with a live demo if available with the specific project. Check back in the future to see my progress in creating fun projects!


### Contact Me section

Potential employers, bursary funders, friends, or anyone impressed with my portfolio website are welcome to send me a message using the contact me form at the bottom of the webpage. I receive the messages in my dashboard and greatly appreciate any feedback.
